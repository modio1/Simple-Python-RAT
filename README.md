# Remote Command Execution Server and Client

This Python project consists of a server and client that enable remote command execution through a basic command-line interface. It is crucial to use this code responsibly and only in scenarios where you have explicit consent from the users involved. Unauthorized access or manipulation of systems is illegal and unethical.

## Features

- **Open Links:** The server can receive commands to open links on the client machine.
- **Delete Files:** The server can receive commands to delete files on the client machine.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x

### Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/remote-command-execution.git
    ```

2. **Change to the project directory:**

    ```bash
    cd remote-command-execution
    ```

### Server

3. **Run the server:**

    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```

4. **The server will start listening for incoming connections on the specified host and port.**

### Client

5. **Run the client:**

    ```bash
    python client.py
    ```

6. **The client will attempt to connect to the specified server.**

## Usage Example

1. Ensure that the server is running and accessible.
2. The client will connect to the server and wait for commands.
3. Commands received from the server will be executed on the client machine:

    ```plaintext
    Connected to server.
    Command: open https://example.com
    Opening link: https://example.com
    ```

## Ethical Considerations

**Responsible Use:**
This code should only be used for educational purposes or in controlled environments where you have explicit permission from the users involved. Unauthorized access or manipulation of systems is illegal and unethical.

**Informed Consent:**
Always ensure that users are fully aware of and consent to the execution of commands on their system. Remote command execution without consent is a clear violation of privacy and may have legal consequences.

**Security Best Practices:**
If you intend to use this code in a production environment, ensure that it adheres to security best practices. Implement secure communication, handle exceptions gracefully, and consider the potential risks associated with remote command execution.

**Note:**
The server and client scripts should be used responsibly, and any modification should be made with caution. Unauthorized use of such scripts may lead to legal consequences.
